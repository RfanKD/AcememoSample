                            <h3>Workflow of the Prototype</h3>
							<p>1. The welcome screen has a “Connect to Facebook” button. The user clicks on the button to get started.</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-001.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>2. Then user is prompted about his/her approval of Acememo using his/her Facebook data.</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-002.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>3. Once the user approves, a screen shows the user account is being set up. While this is happening, the user can swipe to learn more about how to play the game.</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-003.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>4. Once the user account is set up, “Play Game” button appears. User then clicks on this button to start playing the game.</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-004.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-005.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>5. Once the user is done swiping to see how to play the game (optional), he/she is then prompted to choose how many pairs of cards he/she wants to start with and clicks Start. (Default pair number is 1).</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-006.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>6. In the 1st level, the user only has 1 pair of cards he/she has to match. The person and the thing he/she loves is shown on the screen. Once the user is ready to start matching the person with objects she/he just has seen, she clicks “I’m Ready!”</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-007.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-008.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>7. Since the first level serves as a tutorial for the user to understand the gestures needed to play the game, the next screen tells the user “Drag the person onto the image of the thing they like.”</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-009.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>8. Then 2 boxes containing the person and the thing they like is shown on the screen. The user drags the person onto the object.</p>
<img src="img/level1-1.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/level1-2.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>9. Once the pairs are matched, the next screen shows that Level 1 is completed. The user has the option to:<br />
a) Continue to the next level: If the user clicks on this button, he/she will continue to Level 2.<br />
b) Replay the same level again: If the user clicks on this button, he/she will be taken to Level 1 again. <br />
User clicks on “Continue to Next Level”.
</p>

<p>10.	The user is then shown 2 pairs of people and objects in 2 second intervals. Once the user is ready, he/she clicks on “I’m ready!”</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-011.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-012.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-013.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>11.	This time, the user matches 2 people and what they like.</p>

<img src="img/level2-2.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/level2-3.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-015.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>12.	Once the user succeeds, he/she proceeds to level 3.</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-016.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-017.jpg" width="300" height="400">

<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-019.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>13.	User fails to correctly match one of the pairs in level 3.</p>
<img src="img/level3-1.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/level3-2.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<img src="img/level3-3.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>14.	The user is shown the “Game Over!” screen and he sees his score.</p>
<img src="img/acememo_lofi.pdf-page-021.jpg" width="300" height="400">
<p>15.	The user can click on “Restart Game” button to play again or can exit the application.</p>

<h3>Design Decisions</h3>
<h4>1. Social</h4>
<p>One of the main differences of Acememo is that it aims memory improvement through social connections. We’ve decided to make use of the user’s social contacts and facts about them (what they like) in our game.</p>
<p>This high level design decision required us to use data from social networks, in particular, Facebook. So, we have added a Connect to Facebook button on the first welcome screen. When the user clicks on it, he/she will be taken to a page where they are asked if they allow us to use their Facebook data.</p>
<p>Basically, in order to be able to play our game, the user needs a Facebook account. We believe this is a valid decision given our unique offering of a social memory game.</p>

<h4>2. Mobile</h4>
<p>We have decided that our game will be a mobile game only. Having too many versions would compromise our early focus on users and user experience.</p>
<p>So, why mobile? Well, we thought of users that would play this game. This memory game is not something where people can only sit down in their free time and play. They should be able to play this game while waiting on the line, waiting for a bus, or in any social setting where they can afford to spend time. Therefore, the portability of mobile devices allows this level of communication with our users.</p>

<h4>3. Personalization</h4>
<p>We have realized that different kinds of users can want to improve a certain level before they move onto higher levels of Acememo. So one of the high level design goals was to personalize the game for each user’s level and let the user do this at various levels of the game. For example:</p>
<p>1) At the very beginning of the game, we ask the user, “How many pairs of objects would you like to start with?”</p>
<p>2) At the end of each level, the user has the option to replay the level by clicking on the “Replay Level”.</p>

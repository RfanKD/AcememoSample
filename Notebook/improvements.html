    <a name="testing">Alpha System Testing</a>
</h2>
<p>
    We have tested our prototype earlier mostly with elder people and we got some good feedback. This time we wanted to cover an untouched persona we initially
    wrote for the project objective: alcoholic &amp; drug user. We tested our alpha system with Paulina who is 20 years old and she is a drug user. She has
    previously reported having short term memory problems due to her continuous drug use. We were lucky enough to find this person through our friends when we
    were mentioning about our application to them. She fits in the persona perfectly, and as a young and experienced mobile device user, she let us see our app
    in a whole different view. We used the usability testing plan we had prepared earlier and used for the previous test.

</h3>
<p>
    Going through the usability test in order, she relatively had minimal difficulty navigating through the app compared to previous testers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Task 1:</strong>
    She successfully connected to Facebook and started the app. It took her about 5 seconds to do so.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Task 2:</strong>
    She took her time to read the instructions and pressed Start Playing shortly after.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Task 3:</strong>
    Here, she first looked puzzled when she saw the number but then decided to not touch the level increase decrease buttons. As per our instructions, we asked
    her to start with 1 pair, so she pressed Start Game without much thought.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Task 4:</strong>
    Here, she didn’t even spend a second to read the Tutorial text for Level 1. She knew she had to drag and drop the pictures; however, since the pictures are
    small, she had difficulty doing so.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Task 5:</strong>
    She continued to next level, and completed it. We asked her to play the same level again as per our instructions, so she pressed Replay Level and played
    again.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Task 6:</strong>
    She continued to next level and after dealing with small pictures to drag &amp; drop for a while, she completed the level. She failed the level as per our
    instructions. She then viewed her Correct Answers without any problem.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Task 7:</strong>
    After we asked her to play again but starting with level 3, she pressed “Restart Game” and pressed the increase arrow in the first screen until it reached
    3.

<p>
    The different factor with this usability testing was that we focused on entirely different persona. Our tester was young and since she was very used to
    interacting with mobile user interfaces, she gave us some very useful feedback. She was different in the sense that while earlier testers who were elder
    spent considerable amount of time trying to understand a mobile interface they have never seen before, she was at the level to give us the feedback for
    some improvements we were already considering after the demo with our TA.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="interface-evolution">Interface Evolution from Alpha</a>
</h2>
<p>
    We have incorporated some of the feedback we had both from the TA when we gave the alpha demo and the user testing. The improvements on alpha are stated
    below with their justification on their effects on the usability goals.
</p>
<h3>
    1. Increase the Size of the Pictures
</h3>
<p>
    We heard back from both our testers and the TA that the pictures in our app were sometimes too small, especially when using a profile picture where the
    details were too minute to identify. In order to have the player concentrate on the goal of the game rather than the details of a profile picture, we
    decided to increase the size of the images. By doing so, we also made it easier for the player to select and drag the images across the screen. This
    accommodates many more players, seeing as many elderly patients who will be using the app have larger fingers, causing their touch to be less precise than
    most young players. Also, since our one of our usability goals states “User interface interactions take minimal time to complete”, this was a necessary
    change.
</p>
<h3>
    2. Improve Aesthetics
</h3>
<p>
    Similar to the above change, improving the aesthetics of our app will force the player to concentrate more on the game, than on trying to figure out what
    to do or click next. Firstly, by improving the loading screen, the player will be much less bored while waiting for the Facebook images to load. Secondly,
    improving the results screen by adding formatting and color, will make the page more intuitive, and the player will not be obliged to read all the words on
    the screen if they choose not to. Finally, by only having 5 pairs of people and their likes on the game playing screen, it will be easier for the player to
    drag and drop with more space on the screen. Additionally, we have also designed an icon and a logo specifically for this app. This change was necessary
    because of the feedback we got from the TA and our tester. We were aware of it before, but other major changes that focused on reflecting on the usability
    goals delayed us focusing on aesthetics.
</p>
<h3>
    3. Best Score
</h3>
<p>
    By adding a “Best Score” statistic to our game, a player will be more motivated to improve their score at a later date, rather than just playing the game
    over and over again to improve their memory. With this score, the player and the therapist will be able to track their progress over time and see how often
    they are able to improve their best score. Also, having a “Best Score” will encourage the player to continue playing more levels rather than giving up
    earlier than need be. This improvement was inspired by the post-test questionnaire comment from our tester. She said “It would be great if I could see my
    top score. That way I would challenge myself to improve.” We were also thinking about this earlier as one of our usability goals states that “User feels
    encouraged by the system to improve her short term memory”, so this change was necessary to provide that encouragement factor.
</p>
<h3>
    4. Improve Facebook data loading time
</h3>
<p>
    Finally, loading time is something that many players do not have the patience to wait for. By decreasing the loading time for pulling data from Facebook,
    we are decreasing the amount of time that a player has to wait at each level before beginning to play. A shorter wait time will encourage the player to
    play for longer rather than be discouraged and frustrated from having to wait every time they want to play a new level. By improving our Facebook data
    loading time, we targeted our usability goal which states “User interface interactions take minimal time to complete”.

<p>
    We have updated the user manual to reflect all the relevant changes and added functionality that were made to alpha version after testing and TA feedback.

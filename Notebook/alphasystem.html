<h3>
    <a name="test-observations">Summary of Test Observations</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Subject 1: This subject has never used a mobile device before, thus does not know how to interact with a mobile device. He also never played a memory game
    before. He was confused at pretty much every step of testing. Him not being able to understand that multiple users can have multiple likes is an important
    feedback to consider.
</p>
<p>
    Subject 2: This subject has used an iPad before, so she is a relatively experienced user. She also has played card-based physical memory games before. One
    of the important observations from her testing is the fact that she didn’t recognize she had to drag the objects unless they were not aligned with the
    person associated. She also had hard time dragging objects because they were too small.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="group3-feedback">Summary of Heuristic Evaluation and Design Critique</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Throughout their heuristic evaluation and design critique of our project;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Group 3 seemed to like (strengths):</strong>
</p>
<p>
    - The simple game interface
</p>
<p>
    - “Show Correct Answers” screen
</p>
<p>
    <strong>They had constructive feedback about (weaknesses):</strong>
</p>
<p>
    - “Correct Answers” screen doesn’t show the wrong answers, only the correct ones
</p>
<p>
    - Thumbnails are very small and with increasing game levels, it will become hard to read
</p>
<p>
    - There needs to be a visual indication of successful drag and drop
</p>
<p>
    - They thought replacing the heart icon with an arrow would be better sign of the relationship between objects
</p>
<p>
    - The instructions could be highlighted more
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A Comment on Design Critique:</strong>
    It was suggested that focusing on either non-Facebook audience, Facebook audience or both. Referring to results of our earlier testing we have already
    decided to go with the third option: Facebook and non-Facebook audience.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="comparison">Comparison with Earlier Results</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Our initial evaluator who evaluated the low-fidelity prototype had helped us identify 3 important improvements:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>Let the User Know the Correct Answers:</strong>
    Our initial evaluator has told us to show the correct answers to users to help them improve their score by letting them learn their mistakes. Subject 2
    gave feedback in this test that confirmed the importance of this.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Score the User to Incentivize Her:</strong>
    This was also brought up by Subject 2 in formative feedback. She emphasized the importance of scoring the user to keep her motivated. Scoring system was
    not implemented in the computer prototype.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>Implement Gameplay without Facebook:</strong>
    Subject 1 of this testing fits one of our initial personas and he does not have a Facebook account. This issue was brought up by our subject in lo-fi
    prototype testing and we decided to have an option to play the game without Facebook.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="improvements">Prototype Improvements</a>
</h3>
<h4>
    1. Increase the Size of the Pictures
</h4>
<p>
    Based on our observations on testing with both subject, users had difficulties in dragging the pictures. We have decided to increase the size of the
    pictures – a reasonable size that is enough to handle with tip of a finger.
</p>
<h4>
    2. Don’t Align the Pictures
</h4>
<p>
    Our observations from testing with Subject 2 has showed that aligning the pictures of the likes with the people can make the drag &amp; drop action
    unclear. We have actually thought about this earlier but now that the results have shown, we have decided to have random placements for objects on the
    screen.
</p>
<h4>
    3. Implement Scoring System
</h4>
<p>
    This is a change that has been brought up both by subjects and Group 3 and we have thought about this earlier as well. We believe the current levels can
    serve as an incentive for the user. However, this is on top of our list for the “improvements to the alpha system” milestone, we will implement this.
</p>
<h4>
    4. Having Only One Like Per Person
</h4>
<p>
    This has been brought up by Subject 2. She was confused at Level 3 when she has seen many likes for the same people. Then this was suggested by the
    heuristic evaluation
</p>
<h4>
    5. Having a Visual Feedback for Drag and Drop
</h4>
<p>
    Earlier, this has been planned to be in the alpha version but wasn’t included in the prototype because of the complexity of implementation. We have
    implemented a visual feedback for drag and drop, which makes the pictures of people more responsive to the object being dragged on them – automatically
    drops them once they are within a certain range. This also allows us to indicate both correct and wrong answers with different colors after the gameplay on
    the “Show Correct Answers” screen.
</p>
<h4>
    6. Simplifying the “Fact Display” Screen
</h4>
<p>
    In their heuristic evaluation, Group 3 has suggested that we remove the heart icon with an arrow. However, after a brainstorming session, we have decided
    that even an arrow would be a restatement of the same thing because there is a text that says “Emir likes Pizza” and same sentence below is expressed in
    pictures. We have decided to merge these two by having text of the pictures below them and getting rid of the heart icon. So what you see on this screen is
    Emir’s picture in a frame which also includes the text “Emir” below. Next to it is the word “likes” and then next to it is a frame of a pizza picture with
    “Pizza” text below.

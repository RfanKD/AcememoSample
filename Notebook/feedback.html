    Pre-test Questionnaire Results
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>
        Q: Does Samuel practice outside of therapy?
        <br/>
    </strong>
    A: He practices here as well as at a speech therapist appointment every 2 weeks for 50 minutes at a time.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Q: At home, do you create exercises for Samuel to do for practice?
        <br/>
    </strong>
    A: I try to recreate what he’s seen with both his speech therapists and do similar exercises with him, but nothing is done on the computer. I’m sure if
    there existed programs on the computer Samuel would like them very much. We only work with cards and board games.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Q: Does she think that a system of games can motivate a child outside of therapy?
        <br/>
    </strong>
    A: Yes
</p>

<h3>
    Usability Testing
</h3>
<p>
    User 1 (SLP or Parent)
</p>
<p>
    1. Start the application, navigate to the create exercise page. Create a Yes/No exercise with the words cat and hat.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invalid Test. Prototype not ready.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Although the parent was able to navigate to the create exercise page, there was not option to create a Yes/No exercise; therefore this test was skipped.
</p>
<p>
    2. Create a Select Images exercise with Chapeau, Chateau, Soleil, and Poisson. Start the game you just created.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invalid Test. Prototype not ready.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The interface was not available in French; therefore this test was not executed.
</p>
<p>
    3. From the window of the game, change the language of the program and go back to the started game.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invalid Test. Prototype not ready.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The application user interface was not available in French; therefore this test was not executed.
</p>
<p>
    4. Create an exercise with a 10 words, in your preferred language and start the game.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Passed. – </strong>
    only once language barrier was overcome.
</p>
<p>
    It took the user more time than expected to understand what to do; however, this was mostly due to the fact that the interface was in English and the user
    only spoke French. Once the sayings were translated for her, the parent understood more clearly what needed to be done and was able to accomplish it in a
    timely manner.
</p>
<p>
    The parent’s main comment regarding the create exercise interface was that the buttons were much too small and she was having trouble clicking them.
</p>
<p>
    User 2 Child:
</p>
<p>
    1. Start the application and go to the select game page and select a game.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invalid Test. Prototype not ready.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The interface was not available in French; therefore this test was not executed.
</p>
<p>
    2. The examiner will select a “Does it Rhyme exercise” and let the user play.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invalid Test. Prototype not ready.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The application did not include a “Does it Rhyme” exercise; therefore this test was not executed.
</p>
<p>
    3. The examiner will select a “Does it start with A” and let the user play.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Failed.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The child was highly overwhelmed by all the images on the screen and had no idea, at first, as to what he had to do or what he had to drag around. He was
    consistently looking to his mother or to the demonstrator for help and guidance. However, once the tester went through the steps with the child, he knew
    exactly what he was supposed to do, and proceed with ease. Another issue that we noticed the child having was that the words chosen were not suitable for
    his age. There were several pictures in the games that showed fruits that the child had never even heard of before, which makes the game much more
    challenging than it is meant to be.
</p>
<p>
    Both the mother and child made a few comments regarding this test. The child would like to see more colours in the game to make it more appealing and the
    mother stated that the picture should be larger as well as being all of matching sizes. She said that some of the pictures, especially the ones that the
    child did not easily recognize, were too small for this game. The final comment for this test made by the mother was that, as we observed, some of the
    words were much too complicated for a child of her son’s age; an average 6 year-old has no reason to know the word “apricot”. She suggested choosing words
    that were more suitable for his age so that the game was solely based on phonetics rather than learning new words as well as trying to pronounce them
    properly.
</p>
<p>
    4. The examiner will select a “Select the image that ends with [up]” and let the user play.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Passed!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Seeing as this game was very similar to the previous one, the child did not need any explanations what so ever, and began playing as soon as the level had
    loaded. He quickly found the correct answer and was eager to play many more levels.
</p>
<p>
    The only comment that the child made was that he would like there to be more pictures (ie. a larger variety of images so that each level is not a replica
    of the previous one with a different goal).
</p>
<p>
    5. The examiner will open the game on the main page and give it to the child
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Invalid Test. Prototype not ready.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The interface was not available in French; therefore the results of this test would not demonstrate if the child knew what he was doing or was simply clicking buttons on a screen for the fun of it. Also, the child was too young (4 years old) and did not know how to read and write, so he was assisted by the evaluator. For this reason, this test was not executed.</p>
<h3>
    Heuristic Evaluation
</h3>
<p>
    To clear the evaluation bias, each group member has conducted the heuristic evaluation separately. We have then combined the results.
</p>
<h4>
    Visibility of system status
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Heuristic Description:</strong>
    The interface should be providing clear feedback for the user when needed. The system should include visual and auditory feedback that clarifies for the
    user the state of the game. For example, the SLP should know if the exercise was saved or not and the child should know whether he answered correctly or
    not.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Evaluation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Drag &amp; drop should show the object being dragged real time. Whenever the uer drags the object, the object does not follow user’s touch on the screen,
    so it does not give the feeling of being dragged. This is an important visual feedback to have when you have drag &amp; drop functionality.
</p>
<p>
    · If the user spends more time trying to understand the interface, play the question audio again. If the child is confused and is trying to find the
    answer, there is no audio feedback to ask the question again. Since the child who uses this system might not know how to read and write, this audio
    feedback is important to have. The question should be reminded to the user, not just visually but also in audio.
</p>
<h4>
    Match between system and the real world
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Heuristic Description:</strong>
    The system should communicate using an appropriate language for the user. It should follow real world conventions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Evaluation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The game is intended for both French and English user. For English interface, both the gameplay words and the UI are in English. Therefore, there wasn’t
    any resultant confusion. However, when settings are changed into French, only the gameplay words are translated into French. The game UI (Menu, Textview
    and lists) remained in English. For dominate francophones, this may lead to confusions in navigation through the interfaces
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<h4>
    Aesthetic and minimalist design
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Heuristic Description:</strong>
    Windows contain information that is relevant and needed. There is no information exposed that diminishes the visibility of the important info
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Evaluation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · User interface is very simple. Navigation to a different page can be easily completed. However, in the page “prepare exercise” the text and action
    buttons may be a little too small.
</p>
<p>
    · In general, the UI elements should be bigger. The user is having trouble pressing on small items. Considering Fitts’ Law, this is an important factor in
    usability.
</p>
<h4>
    Simplicity of the design
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Heuristic Description:</strong>
    The design of the interface is found to be clear and simple to use. There is no ambiguity in the meaning of the buttons or windows. Also, the positions in
    the interface make it easy for the user.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Evaluation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · There is an easy flow in the design of buttons. The gameplay itself is very intuitive.
</p>
<p>
    · The autocomplete box is irrelevant and never used. We have observed that no one ever attempted to use the autocomplete box to find words. This
    complicates the design and should be eliminated or should be implemented in the word list box in a seamless way.
</p>
<p>
    · The interface to prepare an exercise is a bit complicated. The number of UI elements on the screen can be decreased by following a step-by-step approach
    instead of showing everything at once.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
</p>
<h4>
    Encouraging the User to Learn
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Heuristic Description: </strong>
    The user is motivated by the game and is able to clearly understand the errors that he has made and through the visual or audio animation of the game the
    user is excited to continue playing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Evaluation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · The game should be continuous not per exercise based. Currently, after an exercise is over, the game ends there and goes back to start screen. These are
    very simple exercises and takes very little time to complete. Preparing a new exercise on the other hand takes a long time. Exercises should keep coming to
    keep the user engaged. So, we believe that there should be a way to bundle the exercises to keep the excitement of the user high.
</p>
<p>
    · The gameplay is speech directed. Any mistakes are caught immediately. Therefore, the user will stay on one level if he/she doesn’t get the right answer.
    The audio feedback in the gameplay is good.
</p>
<p>
    · To encourage the children to continue, there can be exciting audio supported visuals. Like clapping sound with a cartoon character clapping the child
    playing the game.
</p>
<h2><a name="test-plan-critique">
    Test Plan Critique</a>
</h2>
<p>
    There were 3 main challenges regarding this testing session. Addressing usability goals, improvements made to the prototype and main flaws will be
    explained in each section.
</p>
<h3>
    1. Invalid Tests
</h3>
<p>
    There were some tests that were invalid because the prototype was not able to process them (see the second section below) and some that didn’t address the
    usability goals.
</p>
<p>
    For example, having a statement like “start the application” does not make a valid test because we are only able to test the design with the boundaries of
    our own creation. Starting the application has nothing to do with the application itself and it has more to do with the operating system being used by the
    test device.
</p>
<p>
    Tests deemed invalid were not executed.
</p>
<h3>
    2. Incomplete Prototype
</h3>
<p>
    There were certain aspects of prototypes that wasn’t functioning. Although some of them could be overcame by using Wizard of Oz Techniques, some couldn’t
    be overcome and effected the testing session.
</p>
<p>
    The testers (parent and child) were francophones; however, the French version of the game was not functioning. To amend for the technical shortcomings, the
    demonstrator used the wizard of Oz technique to carry out testing session. So, the sound of the application was turned off and the evaluator used her own
    voice every time the user interacted with the prototype.
</p>
<p>
    Another part that was confusing was in the gameplay screen. Due to some bug, whenever the child pressed on a picture, it was being dragged to a different
    location, overlapping other pictures on the screen and making it hard to play the game.
</p>
<p>
    Also, “Yes/No” and “Does it rhyme” types of exercise were not ready in the prototype and could not be tested.
</p>
<h3>
    3. The Language Barrier
</h3>
<p>
    Since the child and the parent were francophones, it effected the testing a lot in many different ways. Our friend from Group 3 was there with us, and
    although she was intended to be a translator only, she ended up having the most of the dialogue with the children. This was natural, and not accounted for,
    because the therapist naturally wanted to introduce the French speaker among us to the children. It was hard to get the child to talk with 3 different
    people 2 of which didn’t speak his only language. Same goes with the parent, she had very little or no English. We asked the French speaker evaluator to
    translate the dialogue as often as possible, but as the parent seemed in a hurry towards the end, we couldn’t get as much translations. One of our group
    members who was not with us during the session spoke French and she was able to transcribe some of those dialogues in the recorded video.
</p>
<p>
    Another way this effected testing was that the prototype was not ready yet for French and some features could not be tested or tested with extra assistance
    from the evaluator.
</p>
<h2><a name="design-critique">
    Design Critique</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Based on our heuristic evaluation and observations during the usability testing, we have come up with a formative feedback for Group 5 in 3 main areas of
    improvement for the game.
</p>
<h3>
    1. Step-by-step Approach
</h3>
<p>
    We believe that the certain interactions with the game leave too much to look at the screen and analyze what is going on. A good example is the “Prepare an
    Exercise” screen. There are so many UI elements on this screen and the users can easily be confused as proven by the usability testing.
</p>
<p>
    To make this screen more interesting and easy to interact with for the user, a step-by-step approach should be followed. Such approach can eliminate the
    need to lay out all the UI elements on one screen.
</p>
<p>
    Another area this approach can be implemented is within the gameplay. As explained in the heuristic evaluation, exercises can be bundled together, i.e. one
    exercise after another, step by step, to increase the excitement in the gameplay for the user.
</p>
<h3>
    2. Improvement of UI elements
</h3>
<p>
    In general, the UI elements were easy to interact with and visible enough.
</p>
<p>
    However, some UI elements were too small, and the user failed to be able to click on them. Specifically in the “Prepare an Exercise” screen, this was an
    issue. These elements should be made larger.
</p>
<p>
    Also, the drag &amp; drop action was not very clear. Whenever the user drags a picture on the screen, the object being dragged should follow the finger,
    not stay in its initial location until being dropped to the final location. This visual feedback can be important in many ways. This feature should be
    implemented.
</p>
<h3>
    3. Focus on Tablet Gestures vs. Keyboard
</h3>
<p>
    We have felt that during some parts of the test, there was a confusion on user’s side to whether use the keyboard or the touch screen. This confusion is
    also reflected on the design of the UI elements. The prototype was able to handle both double click on an object or a drag action on the same object for
    the word list when the user wanted to prepare an exercise. When two different actions using two different input methods can have the same results on the
    screen, this might be considered as a flexibility for the advanced user but it’s most likely a confusion for a novice user. Limiting the ways of
    interaction and designing the user interface for touch actions, or keystrokes/mouse actions is an important decision that needs to be made. And the final
    product should be presented to the users in that format. Having a half mobile half desktop system can confuse novice users due to its complicated
    consequences in user interface design.

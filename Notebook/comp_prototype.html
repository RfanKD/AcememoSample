<h2>
    <a name="prototype">Prototype Development</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    How has your vision of the project changed from the time of conception?
</h3>
<p>
    So far everything that we have wanted to implement in our application has worked as planned; therefore our vision has 

solely changed based on the feedback
    we received from our tester last week. After demonstrating our paper prototype we received feedback that we should 

first of all allow players to play our
    game even if they do not have a Facebook account. Secondly, we should allow users to complete the level before 

letting them know that they made a mistake.
    It was also suggested that we should keep track of the user’s score in each level and present it to them immediate 

after they complete the level. Lastly,
    our experimenter made the suggestion that we should allow the users to return and view the mistakes that they made 

once the level is finished.
</p>
<h3>
    Design Decisions
</h3>
<h4>
    Play without a Facebook account
</h4>
<p>
    By adding the option of playing without a Facebook account, in addition to having the “Play with Facebook” option, we 

are increasing our user base by
    allowing anyone to play our game. Also, as was explained to us by our tester, it will be harder for a patient to 

remember something about a randomly
    generated person from the Facebook graph api that they don’t know as opposed to remembering a characteristic about a 

family member or friend who they have
    known for a very long time. For this reason, not only does playing without Facebook increase the user base, but it 

also increases the difficulty of the
    game to some extent.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of feasibility, the algorithms for both the with Facebook and without Facebook versions of the game are 

identical, the only thing that changes are
    the data sets from which you are pulling the information to memorize. For this reason, it is extremely feasible to 

provide the option of playing without
    Facebook.
</p>
<h4>
    Allow Level Completion
</h4>
<p>
    By allowing a user to complete a level, you are allowing them to rethink their decision and change their mind. This 

is much better for the usability of the
    game seeing as it allows the user to connect the people that they think are correct, in order for them to determine 

the rest of the connections which they
    might not be too certain about. If they do happen to make a mistake in the first few connections and pick up on their 

mistake before completing the level,
    they may move their answers around which proves that their memory is improving and although they might not have 

remembered the connection right away, they
    just needed a little bit of time to figure it out correctly. Also, allowing a user to complete a level instead of 

cutting it off as soon as they make a
    mistake, makes a user feel much better than telling them they failed and not letting them try to figure out their 

mistake.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of feasibility, it is very simple to make thing change, seeing as the correct connections must be kept in 

memory anyways. Whether we check for
    correctness as the player is playing the level, or we once all the connections have been made, the checking code is 

still extremely similar; the main
    difference is basically just the number of checks that are being done at the same time. This change is worth 

implementing seeing as it will definitely help
    the user improve and keep their moral high.
</p>
<h4>
    Keep Track of User’s Score
</h4>
<p>
    This goes hand in hand with the previous design decision, because by letting the player complete the level, there 

must be some way of notifying them how
    many answers they got right and how many they misconnected. It is definitely something that will motivate the users 

to improve themselves for next time, so
    that they can not only go further in the levels, but also increase their scores even on the levels in which they did 

poorly.
</p>
<p>
    Feasibility-wise, this design is extremely easy to implement seeing as we will be checking the correctness of each of 

the connections anyways. We will just
    have to keep track of how many connections were made correctly, and how many were made incorrectly; this number will 

then be displayed on the results
    screen following the level.
</p>
<h4>
    Allow Users to View Mistakes
</h4>
<p>
    Once again, this decision goes along with the two previous ones; seeing as you are letting the user play until the 

end of the level and you are providing
    them with the score that they received on the level, there must be some way for them to check to see the mistakes 

that they made. Enabling users to view
    their mistakes will allow them to see exactly which connections were wrong, as well as how far off they were from the 

correct answer. This could help the
    user determine why they made the mistake. For example, did they make the mistake because the accidently chose the 

wrong image when making the connection
    (ie. one image looked like another), or did they simply do not remember which person belonged with which item.
</p>
<p>
    Out of the four new design decisions, this is definitely the most complicated to implement; however, all the 

information will already be stored. Before
    starting the level, the correct connections will be stored in a data structure, and the connections being made by the 

user during the game will be stored
    in a separate data structure. So, even though viewing the users results is not something that was already being done, 

all the information that is needed is
    stored, and the only thing that needs to be done is analyse it and display it in a format that is easy for the user 

to comprehend. Although this is not the
    simplest of tasks, the tester was extremely certain that this would help the user and their therapist with their 

learning and improvements, therefore we
    believe that it is a key implementation to have.
</p>
<p>
    <em></em>
</p>
<h3>
    Critical Functionality
</h3>
<p>
    The functionalities that we believe are critical for this stage of the design are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>How to Play</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o The how to play instructions on the main page will allow the user to figure out how exactly to use our application 

without us having to tell them
    anything.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Facebook Login UI (no background functionality)</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o The Facebook UI is more of a formality than a functionality. We want the testers to go through the motions of 

registering their Facebook account to
    ensure that it flows well and is intuitive, but for the purpose of this prototype, it is not important that the data 

comes from Facebook.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Select Level</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o We want the user to be able to play the game from level 1 as if they have never played it before, but we also want 

to see if it is intuitive enough to
    change levels but varying the number of pairs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Minimum 2 working levels</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Seeing as all the levels are fairly similar, 2 levels will give us a good idea of how the UI flows between the 

levels. There is no need to overload the
    tester with several more levels which are similar to the first 2.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Drag &amp; Drop</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o We want to ensure that the drag and drop motion is the best, most intuitive and simplest way to play our game. 

Ensuring that this functionality is
    implemented for this prototype is essential.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Restart Game / Replay Level</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Allows the tester to play around in the application and do what they want rather than follow a linear path through 

the levels. This will hopefully bring
    on more feedback about each of the levels, rather than only letting them play each level once.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>View Errors</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o This screen does not have to be extremely refined, it just has to be enough to show the testers the mistakes that 

they made and which are the correct
    connections. The basic goal here is to test our ideas seeing as we did not get to test this section during the paper 

prototype testing.

<h2>
    <a name="usability-testing">Usability Testing Procedures</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    Usability Goals to be Tested
</h3>
<p>
    1. User interface requires minimal learning
</p>
<p>
    a) Buttons are clear
</p>
<p>
    b) Drag and drop action can be understood
</p>
<p>
    2. User interface interactions take minimal time to complete
</p>
<p>
    3. User feels encouraged by the system to improve her short term memory
</p>
<p>
    4. User can learn from his/her mistakes
</p>
<h3>
    Types of Users Required
</h3>
<p>
    Ideally, since the game targets users with short term memory problems that may stem from different health conditions, 

testers should have some sort of
    short term memory problems. Although some usability goals – i.e. related to the user interface – can be tested with 

people who do not fit in this
    description.
</p>
<h3>
    Number of Examiners
</h3>
<p>
    We need 3 examiners in total:
</p>
<p>
    · One examiner will coordinate the testing session – i.e. briefing, walking through each test, etc.
</p>
<p>
    · One examiner will measure all the quantitative and behavioral data
</p>
<p>
    · One examiner will record the testing session for later reviewing
</p>
<h3>
    Testing Equipment
</h3>
<p>
    · An Android smartphone (ideally running Android 4.0+) to run the application
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A video camera to record the testing session
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · A device with stopwatch ability to measure timing on certain tasks
</p>
<p>
    · Pen/pencil or computer to record observations and results
</p>
<h3>
    Handling the Prototype
</h3>
<p>
    Although the instructions on “how to play the game” are included within the application, we have included all the 

steps to install and run the application
    and play the game in the user manual. If the Android smartphone used for testing comes with the application 

installed, the user can skip the instructions.
    Reading the manual is completely optional and is not necessary for a mobile device user as the instructions on how to 

play the game are already illustrated
    within the prototype of the game.
</p>
<h3>
    Instructions for the Examiner
</h3>
<p>
    1. First, introduce the project
</p>
<p>
    2. Let the user know that the session is being recorded and ask them to sign the consent form to have their full 

consent on using all the data acquired
    from the testing
</p>
<p>
    3. Go through the briefing session
</p>
<p>
    4. Go through the pre-test questionnaire
</p>
<p>
    5. Conduct the usability evaluation
</p>
<p>
    6. Conduct the heuristic evaluation
</p>
<p>
    7. Go through the debriefing session
</p>
<p>
    8. Conduct the post-test questionnaire
</p>
<h3>
    Effects of the Feedback on Design Decisions
</h3>
<p>
    The test is designed to improve usability goals, so we take into account all the results in testing of our prototype, 

and after TA feedback if the
    improvements are seen as necessary, we go forward with them.
</p>
<h2>
    <a name="usability-test">Usability Test</a>
</h2>
<p>
    Examiners should not say anything or reveal other information to test subjects other than the stated instructions for 

each task during this usability test.
    Examiners should also not show any gestures during the game play.
</p>
<p>
    Here is the evaluation template for each task being conducted during the test:
</p>
<p>
    Optimal Action: For each task, if the user fully completes the optimal action, the task is considered successful. No 

need to consider revisions in design.
</p>
<p>
    Failing Action: If the user does any one of the failing actions, then the task is considered as failed and design 

decisions needs to be revised.
</p>
<p>
    Observations to be Recorded: These are the observations to be recorded for each task by one of the evaluators. 

Whether the task resulted with optimal or
    failing action should always be recorded.
</p>

</p>
<h2>
    <a name="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</a>
</h2>
<p>
    We use heuristic evaluation to test our usability goals and get some expert advice on how to improve our design.
</p>
<h3>
    1. Encourage the User to Learn by Failure
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>
    The end goal of Acememo is to improve the short term memory of the user, so we want the user to learn by her failures 

to improve her short term memory.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question:</strong>
    Is the user encouraged to learn from his/her failures? If not, can you think of any improvements to make this 

possible?
</p>
<h3>
    2. Tailoring for Users of Different Experience Levels
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>
    Personas of people with short term memory can vary a lot. It can be a young drug user or an old person suffering from 

dementia. They might have used a
    smartphone or not. They might have a Facebook account or not.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question:</strong>
    Do you think the current design is tailored to users of different experience levels? If not, how could this be 

improved?
</p>
<h3>
    3. User Interface Requires Minimal Learning
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>
    Since the game already requires some usage of memory, the user should not be further confused by being forced to 

memorize user interface actions. All the
    UI elements should be easy to understand and require minimal learning.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question:</strong>
    Are all the UI gestures such as drag &amp; drop obvious? Is there a learning curve for these actions? If so, how can 

this be improved?
</p>
<h3>
    4. Simplicity of the User Interface
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>
    In order to cater to all users with different experience level, it is important to make sure that user interface is 

free from clutter. All the buttons and
    workflows of the game should be minimal. Information displayed on the screen should not distract the user.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question:</strong>
    Is there any UI element, activity or information that is excessive? If so, how can a simpler workflow can be achieved 

by removing it?
</p>
<h3>
    5. Gameplay “How-to” is Accessible
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>
    Although the game is simple and most likely won’t require the user to read a manual, it should provide accessible 

how-to information for users with lower
    experience level in mobile device usage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question:</strong>
    Do you think our “how to play the game” instructions are accessible and clear? If not, how can it be improved?
</p>
<h3>
    6. Mobile Gameplay Experience
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>
    Acememo is tailored for mobile gameplay experience. Users should be able to play it while waiting for a bus or 

waiting on a line. They can play it
    on-the-go or on leisure.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question:</strong>
    Do you think Acememo completely suits the mobile experience? What features does it lack for mobile gameplay, if there 

is any?

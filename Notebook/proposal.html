							<h4>Lumosity</h4><p>
<a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> is a web application created for anyone to use. It is made as a brain training tool to strengthen an already present short term memory. This game takes the user through several levels all while keeping track of the user’s progress in all cognitive sections. This application also allows users to view their progress as well as see the areas in which their short term memory is best and where it needs improvements.
	</p>
	

<h4>Brain Metrix</h4><p>
<a href="http://www.brainmetrix.com/cognitive-training/">Brain Metrix</a> is a website which contains multiple types of brain training games. The variety of games on this site is much greater and are much more fun to play than on most brain training programs.Unfortunately this site does not contain any tracking system, nor does it allow you to have a record of which games you have already completed. 
	
</p>

<h4>Games for the Brain:</h4><p>
<a href="http://www.gamesforthebrain.com/">Games for the Brain</a> is a website, similar to Brain Matrix, which contains several games meant to improve the users short term memory. It does not have any progress or game completion tracking; however it does have games in over 10 different languages. This is a very useful thing to have, because the users short term memory could be challenged with both the game and the language if they are playing a game in a language which is not their mother tongue.
</p>
<br><br>
							
							<h3>Product Comparison</h3>
							
							<p>AceMemo’s approach to memory loss recovery is different, because other than regular memory improvement applications it focuses on:
</p>
<p>1. <strong>Social:</strong> We believe socializing is big part of improving memory because social interactions helps avoid depression and stress that may cause memory loss. We let users interact with their loved ones  via social media and even give them social challenges on a daily basis.
</p>
<p>2.<strong> Organization skills:</strong> Throughout the app, we encourage our users to become organized with small incentives. We try to encourage the usage of the application as a routine by notifying them on a daily basis. Studies have shown that routines might avoid confusion for a person who is trying to recover from memory losses.
</p>
<p>3. <strong>Challenge the brain on different levels:</strong> We challenge the human brain on many different levels: both visually and vocally. Different from similar solutions, we make use of many research projects that show audio can be used in memory recovery.
<p>
A large difference between AceMemo and other, already existing, brain training games, is that our product is specifically geared towards users with short term memory issues. This being said, the levels and tasks that the users will have to complete in AceMemo will be easier and much more trivial than the levels in other games. The main reason for this is because a level which may seem easy to complete for someone with a good memory, will be extremely difficult for someone with short term memory issues. AceMemo’s main purpose is to help reinstate and rehabilitate a person’s short term memory; once they are able to complete all of AceMemo’s levels, a user can move onto other, more difficult brain training games.

							<h3>High Level Design</h3>
							
							<p>We will use a free HTML5 web engine like Lime.JS and we will use a client-server architecture throughout the software. Everything will be stored on the server and the client will request the webpage to start using the application.
</p>
<p>User information will be stored in a MySQL database and for server side operations, we will use PHP via AJAX requests.
</p>
<p>We will use Facebook and Twitter APIs to help users socialize via the application.
</p>
<p>For the reasons of prototyping, we are planning to take advantage of many frameworks as possible to save time on development and spend that time to focus on our users early.
</p>
<p>In the end, we are planning to have a web application with a responsive design that can be viewed in desktop browsers as well as mobile browsers.
	</p>					
	<img src="highlevel.jpg" width="500" height="425"><br>
	<br><br>	
							<h3>Feasibility Justification</h3>
							<p>
							Once we assemble and experiment with several HTML5 game engines, we will choose one framework and start the development process based on the initial user information we have gathered. Then we will set up a server and database to store information.
</p>
<p>We will use the model-driven software engineering approach. Once we build our models, we will design the architecture and then start implementing it.
</p>
<p>We will divide the work between team members into two: Back-end (PHP & server communications) + front-end (HTML5 + CSS/graphics + JavaScript). All our team members have some sort of background in software development, so we will collaborate
</p>
<p>We will look into implementing several auto-tracking services to track user behavior - like Google Analytics and heatmaps. Our testing will be based on this tracking service and direct user behavior observation.
</p>
<p>We will start testing with the users when we finish implementing our first feature and observe users’ behavior to provide better functionality and user experience. We will ask users and their families the impact our software had on their short term memory and we will test them using our software on a regular basis. Specifically, we will also make use of A/B testing.
</p>
<p>We will continue development concurrently and will continue testing on each feature release and get feedback from our users. We will go into final user testing phase once we have completed all the features which is an exhaustive test of all features.
